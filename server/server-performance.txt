Tuning the server performance
=============================

At the heart of the Neo4j server is a regular Neo4j storage engine instance. That engine can be tuned in the same way as the other embedded
configurations, using the same file format. The only difference is that the server must be told where to find the fine-tuning configuration.

.Quick info
***********
* The neo4j.properties file is a standard configuration file that databases load in order to tune their memory use and caching strategies.
* See <<configuration-caches>> for more information.

Specifying the tuning properties
--------------------------------

The conf/neo4j-server.properties file in the server distribution, is the main configuration file for the server. In this file we can specify 
a second properties file that contains the database tuning settings (that is, the neo4j.properties file). This is done by setting a single
property to point to a valid neo4j.properties file:

 org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties={neo4j.properties file}
 
On restarting the server the tuning enhancements specified in the neo4j.properties file will be loaded and configured into the underlying database engine.
