Starting the Neo4j server in high availability mode
===================================================

To run the Neo4j server in high availability mode there are two things you need to do.
You have to configure the server to start up the database in high availability mode and you have to configure the Neo4j database for operating in high availability mode.

Instructing the server to start the database in high availability mode is as easy as setting the +org.neo4j.server.database.mode+ property in the server properties file (+neo-server.properties+) to +ha+.
The default value for this parameter is +standalone+, which will start the database in standalone mode.

Configuring the Neo4j database for operating in high availability mode requires sepcifying a few properties in +neo4j.properties+.
First you need to specify +ha.server+, this is the hostname and port on which other servers in the cluster should communicate with this server.

Example: +ha.server = neo4j-server-01:6001+.

Then you need to specify +ha.machine_id+, this is an integer id that uniquely identifies this server in the cluster.

Example: +ha.machine_id = 1+

Finally you have to specify +ha.zoo_keeper_servers+, this is a comma separated list of hosts and ports for communicating with the Neo4j cluster manager.

Example: +ha.zoo_keeper_servers = neo4j-manager-01:2180,neo4j-manager-02:2180,neo4j-manager-03:2180+.
