Contributing to Neo4j
=====================

There's a rather outdated guide on this topic in the wiki: http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Code_Contributor%27s_Guide
This information will be updated and moved to the manual.

One crucial aspect of contributing is the http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/About_Contributor_License_Agreement[Contributor License Agreement].
In short: make sure to sign the CLA, or the Neo4j project won't be able to accept your contribution.
