Preface
=======

This is the reference manual for Neo4j version {neo4j-version}, written by the Neo4j Team.

// docs == reality

The main parts of the manual are:

* <<introduction>>
* <<tutorials>>
* <<reference-documentation>> 
* <<tools>>
* <<help>>
* <<manpages>>

The material is practical, technical, and focused on answering specific questions. 
It addresses how things work, what to do and what to avoid to successfully run Neo4j in a production environment. 
After a brief introduction, each topic area assumes general familiarity as it addresses the particular details of Neo4j.
 
The goal is to be thumb-through and rule-of-thumb friendly.

Each section should stand on its own, so you can hop right to whatever interests you.
When possible, the sections distill "rules of thumb" which you can keep in mind whenever you wander out of the house without this manual in your back pocket.

_Who should read this?_

The topics should be relevant to architects, administrators, developers and operations personnel.
You should already know about Neo4j and using graphs to store data.
If you are completely new to Neo4j please check out http://neo4j.org first.
