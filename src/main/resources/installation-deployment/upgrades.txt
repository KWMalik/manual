Upgrading
=========

A properly shutdown Neo4j database can be upgraded directly to a new minor version. 
Forward compatibility is only guaranteed between minor versions, for example from 1.1 to 1.2.
Databases cannot be downgraded. 

To upgrade directly:

. download the new server release
. configure the server to point to the existing database directory
. cleanly shutdown the previous server
. startup the new server
