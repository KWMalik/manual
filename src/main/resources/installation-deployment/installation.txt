Installation
============

Neo4j can be installed as a server, running either as a headless application or system service.
For Java developers, it is also possible to use Neo4j as a library, embedded in your application.

For information on installing Neo4j as a server, see <<server-installation>>.

== Embedded Installation ==

The latest release is always available from from http://neo4j.org/download, packaged as part of the Neo4j server.
After selecting the appropriate version for your platform, embed Neo4j in your Java application, by including the 
Neo4j library jars in your build. Either take the jar files from the +lib+ directory of the download, or directly 
use the artifacts available from Maven Central Repository footnote:[http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/neo4j/].
