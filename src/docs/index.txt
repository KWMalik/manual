Neo4j Manual Meta Docs
======================

For how to build the manual see:
https://github.com/neo4j/manual/blob/master/README.asciidoc[readme]

The documents use the asciidoc format, see:

* http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Aciidoc Reference]
* http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet]

The cheatsheet is really useful!

== Overall Flow ==

Each (sub)project has its own documentation, which will produce a 'docs.jar' file.



== Headings and document structure ==

Each document starts over with headings from level zero (the document title).
Each document should have an id.
In some cases sections in the document need to have id's as well, this depends on where they fit in the overall structure.
To be able to link to content, it has to have an id.
Missing id's in mandatory places will fail the build.

This is how a document should begin:

----
[[unique-id-verbose-is-ok]]
The Document Title
==================
----

To push the headings down to the right level in the output, the +leveloffset+ 
attribute is used when including the document inside of another document.

Subsequent headings in a document should use the following syntax:

----
== Subheading ==

... content here ...

=== Subsubheading ===

content here ...

----

== Writing ==

Put one sentence on each line. This makes it easy to move around content,
and also easy to spot (too) long sentences.

== Gotchas ==

* A chapter can't be empty. (the build will fail on the docbook xml validity check)
* The document title should be "underlined" by the same
  number of +=+ as there are characters in the title.
* Always leave a blank line at the end of documents
  (or the title of the next document might end up in the last
  paragraph of the document)
* As +{}+ are used for Asciidoc attributes, everything inside will be treated as an attribute.
  What you have to do is to escape the opening brace: +\\{+.
  If you don't the braces and the text inside them will be removed without any warning being issued!

== Links ==

To link to other parts of the manual the id of the target is used.
This is how such a reference looks:

----
<<target-id>>
----

[NOTE]
This tag will generate output like "Chapter 9, Transaction Management".
So just write "see \<<the-id>>" and similar.

If you need to link to another document with your own link text, this is what to do:

----
<<target-id, my much better text for the link>>
----

NOTE: Writing your own link text means you're going to keep it in sync with the title of target text in the future, in case that changes.

External links are added like this:

----
http://neo4j.org/[Link text here]
----

== Text Formatting ==

* Path: \'my/path/' renders as 'my/path/'

== Attributes ==

Common attributes you can use in documents:

* \{neo4j-version}
* \{neo4j-git-tag}

These can substitute part of URLs that point to for example APIdocs or source code.
Note that neo4j-git-tag also handles the case of snapshot/master.

== Comments ==

There's a separate build including comments.
The comments show up with a yellow background.
It's located at http://docs.neo4j.org/annotated/.
You can also use this page to search for content, as the full manual is on a single page.
WARNING: Don't share links to this page, as we want people to use the Disqus feature available in the normal chunked version.

Here's how to write a comment:

----
// this is a comment
----

The comments are not visible in the normal build.
Comment blocks won't be included in the output of any build at all.
Here's a comment block:

----
////
Note that includes in here will still be processed, but not make it into the output.
////
----


== Toolchain ==
