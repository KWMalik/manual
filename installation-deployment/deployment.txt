Deployment Scenarios
====================

Neo4j can be embedded into your application, run as a standalone server or deployed on several machines to provide high availability. 

.Neo4j deployment options
[cols="^s,^,^", frame="none", options="header"]
|==================================================================
|            | Single Instance       | Multiple Instances
| Embedded   | EmbeddedGraphDatabase | HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase
| Standalone | Neo4j Server          | not yet available
|==================================================================

== Server ==

Neo4j is normally accessed as a standalone server, either directly through a REST interface or through a language-specific driver.

== Embedded ==

Neo4j can be embedded directly in a server application by including the appropriate Java libraries.
When programming, you can refer to the +GraphDatabaseService+ API.
To switch from a single instance to multiple highly available instances, simply switch from the concrete +EmbeddedGraphDatabase+ to the +HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase+.
